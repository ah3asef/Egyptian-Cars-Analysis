# About This Project:
First of all there are outliers in every numeric column and we didn't remove it because we will lose data and the outlier of this data represents group of egyptian people

## Dealing with the outliers:
We Visualize the data before the outliers and after outliers and but it's not logical to remove the outliers because it's represents group of egyptian people and it's more than 1500 row if we take it as price and for the year and mileage we don't have the idea is this correct or not because they were filled by users
